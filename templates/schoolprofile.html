<p><B>As Maharishi Ji has stated "An action is to be rightly thought and the steps to be accomplished are to be rightly planned” we are always striving forward to accomplish our best in every sphere. Maharishi Vidya Mandir strongly believes in the holistic development of children in order to mould them to cater to the needs of the society. The school is being run by the Maharishi Institute of Creative Intelligence U.P. which is a Society registered under the Societies Registration Act of 1860. The ideal aim of the school is to nurture the tender shoots of the rural sect and work towards the betterment of the society. </p>
<p><B>The unique feature of this school is teaching of Transcendental Meditation to every child admitted to the school. It is a simple, natural, effortless procedure whereby the mind easily and naturally arrives at the source of the thought, the settled state of mind - Transcendental consciousness - Pure consciousness, self-referral consciousness, which is the source of all creative processes. To groom the students in the field of spirituality there are Bhajans conducted on Thursdays. These Bhajans are preceded by an anecdote read out from the life of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and a hymn from the Bhagavath Gita. The students of our school are strengthened physically, mentally and morally to adapt themselves to the future society through yogic exercises and Transcendental Meditation. All the students and staff of the school meditate both in the morning and afternoon sessions. </p>
<p><B>Maharishi Vidya Mandir is located in 64 acre plot with blocks namely Ved Bhavan, Hasthamalaka, Vasishta Bhavan, Vyas Bhavan, Padmapadha, Trotakacharya & Varthikakar ( Library – 3000 sq.feet). The school strength is around 6858 which is taken care of by around 350 Teaching and Non-teaching staff. </p>
<p><B>The serene atmosphere of the school is enhanced through lawns, Bird Sanctuary, Duck pond and Swimming pool. The greenery found throughout the school campus, added to the chirping of birds provides the students a natural environment to learn. </p>
