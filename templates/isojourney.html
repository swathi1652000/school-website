<p><b>Quality is the coin word that the world today chants. Success, victory, prosperity, popularity, fame all these depend on quality. The measurement of such quality becomes inevitable and hence we look for the standard logos like Hallmark, Ag mark, BIS for every rupee invested. The same goes with educational institutions too. An ISO certified school has its own credits. Earning such an iconic recognition needs dedication. Our school started its journey to obtain the ISO 9001:2008 certificate in August 2011. Since then, every day, we learnt and understood our Quality Management Systems better. The ministerial staff, transport staff, teaching and non – teaching staff, everyone has an insight of the Quality Policy. The most important cadre, students, too have internalized it. Attaining our Quality Objectives is the main vision today. The safety measures taken, hygienic sanitation facilities provided, facelift given, concern shown towards environmental protection, infrastructural developments evidence the successful journey towards ISO certification. This was possible with great support rendered by every member of the prestigious family.
The visit of TUV SUD auditors on 10th, 11th, and 12th of October 2012 was as exciting as the last ball in a cricket match. And when it was a six, Wow! What a win it was! All praises received from the auditors were laid at the lotus feet of His Holiness Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Today, the beautiful Taj Mahal wouldn’t have been there if Shahjahan hadn’t dreamt of it. So is our ISO certified school. The journey and its achievement were made realistic under the expertise of our Secretaries and Principal. Being a part of this ISO School is like a dream come true for every student and employee. We, the ISO core team members, wish to see the fertility of the teaching – learning place increase where everyone involves emotionally, intellectually, willingly and enthusiastically in every activity year after year.</b>
